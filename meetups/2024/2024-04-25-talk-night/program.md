## Building Rust for Production
By [Kasper Juul Hermansen][kjh]

Building [Rust] with [Cargo] is quite easy - until it is isn't. In this talk I will go into how to build
[Rust] for production so that you get the most out of [Cargo], solve common pitfalls, and get a fast 
and effective development environment. As a bonus I am gonna give a sneak peek of how to build [Rust]
effectively for a [Docker] container using [Dagger].

Kasper is a Developer Experience Engineer working at Lunar where he currently spends his time working 
on developer tooling, and building high performance data application, mostly in [golang]. 
In his spare time he maintains the [dagger rust sdk], and moonlights as a [Rust] developer

## Location
This meetup will be at Margrethepladsen 4, 3, 8000 Aarhus (bottom floor of Scandinavian Center).

## Food
We will try to have a combination of vegan and non-vegan food. If you have special needs regarding food (e.g. allergies), please forward your request to tue@rustaarhus.dk.
